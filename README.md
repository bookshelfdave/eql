EQL: an Elasticsearch Query Language (prototype)
---



## Sample queries

```
connect localhost:9300;
// or
connect elasticsearch localhost:9300;
// only a single connection is supported at the moment

// match all
query bank;

// return a single document
query bank return 1;

// return 10 docs starting from 5
query bank return 10 from 5;

query bank return 3 sort on balance asc;

// multiple sorts
query bank return 3 sort on balance asc, lastname desc;

// only return account_number + balance columns
query bank (account_number, balance);

query bank (account_number, balance) return 1;

// filters
query bank
    filter balance = 1110
    return 1;

query bank
  filter balance = 1110
    and age = 27
  return 1;


query bank (balance, age, account_number)
  filter
    balance = 1110
    and (age = 31 or account_number=953)
  return 1;
  
index blogposts with post = '{"xyz":"this is a test", "foobar":100}';

index blogposts with post = '{"xyz":"this is another test", "foobar":200}';

// query by exact id, this won't work for you unless you use an ID 
// returned from an "index" statement above.
get blogposts with post = "AU3Po0OOZX4PYDrqsDN1";

// xyz will be analyzed, so it might not return a value
// match on 100 for this example instead
query blogposts(xyz, foobar) filter foobar=100;  

// Simple Aggregations
query bank
  aggregate min_bal = min(balance), max_bal = max(balance);

// filters AND aggregations
query bank
    filter
        age = 20
    aggregate
        foo = min(balance), bar = max(balance);
```

##FAQ

- How is it pronounced?
    - "equal"

- Why didn't you implement SQL?
    - Elasticsearch isn't a SQL database.

- Is EQL usable in production?
    - ***NO NO NO***
    - It's just an idea I had over the weekend.

- Are you going to finish this?
    - if theres any interest in it.

- Can I contribute?
    - you can submit a github issue for suggestions on how parts of the query should look.
